# Nest Queryify

Use a query object design pattern to write elasticsearch commands via the NEST library.

## Requirements

As of version 0.10.0 support for Elasticsearch version prior to v5 has been dropped, the nuget packages have a minimum NEST dependency which in turn relates to a specific major Elasticsearch release.  If you need to continue using Queryify for v1 elasticsearch clusters then please install v0.7.0 from nuget.
