# Getting started with Nest-Queryify

## Installing via NuGet

Nest-Queryify can be installed from the nuget package manager, either install it from the nuget package manager UI within Visual Studio or type the following command into the package manager console:

```
install-package Nest-Queryify
```

It goes without saying that Nest-Queryify has a dependency on the excellent [Nest](http://nest.azurewebsites.net) library which will be downloaded as a dependency.
